title: Machine Learning Model for Predicting Functional Groups from IR Spectra
description: We fine-tuned a machine learning model to analyze chemical mixtures with IR spectroscopy, as existing models only handle pure compounds. Our process involved reproducing a state-of-the-art model, scraping and processing 60,000+ spectra, and then fine-tuning for binary mixtures.
